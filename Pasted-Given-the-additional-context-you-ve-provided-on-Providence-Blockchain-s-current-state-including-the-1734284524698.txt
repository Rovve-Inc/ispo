Given the additional context you‚Äôve provided on Providence Blockchain‚Äôs current state, including the low Hash token volume and the upcoming centralized exchange push, I have a refined perspective for your ISPO and overall tokenomics structure. Let me break it down:

1. ISPO Allocation Recommendation
	‚Ä¢	5% of the total supply feels like the sweet spot:
	‚Ä¢	Why 5%?
	‚Ä¢	Balances incentivizing early adoption while minimizing dilution for future utility and funding.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs enough to attract Web3 participants and create community momentum, even if Providence Blockchain adoption starts slow.
	‚Ä¢	Leverage Providence‚Äôs Timing:
Their marketing and exchange listings in Q1/Q2 2025 align well with your ISPO. Early participants will feel confident that buying pressure will follow as the Hash ecosystem scales.
	‚Ä¢	Upper Limit: I would avoid exceeding 7%. A higher allocation risks:
	‚Ä¢	Oversaturating your token supply early on.
	‚Ä¢	Giving away too much value for relatively low engagement (considering Hash‚Äôs low trading volume).
	‚Ä¢	Comparison to Zivoe:
Zivoe‚Äôs breakdown is 30% Investors, which aligns with a strong investor-heavy narrative. For Rove, your ISPO should emphasize community-building and decentralization, not just investor-heavy control. A 5% allocation will resonate better with retail and Web3 stakeholders.

2. Total Token Supply Recommendations

To ensure flexibility and scalability, I suggest a total token supply between 100M and 250M RV Tokens. Here‚Äôs why:
	‚Ä¢	100M Total Supply:
	‚Ä¢	Feels clean and manageable for an early-stage project.
	‚Ä¢	Easier for participants to understand (e.g., ‚Äú5M allocated for ISPO = 5%‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	Makes rewards/utility feel significant without overwhelming inflation later.
	‚Ä¢	250M Total Supply:
	‚Ä¢	Provides flexibility for long-term incentives, liquidity pools, staking rewards, and future fundraising.
	‚Ä¢	If you‚Äôre thinking big and expect significant utility (e.g., payments, rewards, governance), a higher cap makes sense.
	‚Ä¢	It also allows you to allocate tokens to new stakeholders (partnerships, community campaigns, etc.) as your ecosystem grows.

Suggested Tokenomics Framework

Here‚Äôs a proposed high-level token distribution:

Category	% Allocation	Purpose
ISPO	5%	Community building, validator rewards
Airdrop/Community Rewards	10-12%	Future marketing incentives, airdrops
Public Sale (Token Presale)	8-10%	Raise capital, attract retail buyers
Investors (Private Round)	20-25%	Strategic VCs, early institutional funds
Team & Advisors	15-20%	Incentivize long-term commitment
Ecosystem Development	20-25%	Partnerships, staking rewards, liquidity
Treasury	10-15%	Reserved for future needs, growth

Example for a 100M Total Supply:
	‚Ä¢	ISPO: 5M tokens (5%)
	‚Ä¢	Airdrops/Rewards: 10M tokens (10%)
	‚Ä¢	Presale: 8M tokens (8%)
	‚Ä¢	Investors: 25M tokens (25%)
	‚Ä¢	Team/Advisors: 15M tokens (15%)
	‚Ä¢	Ecosystem: 25M tokens (25%)
	‚Ä¢	Treasury: 12M tokens (12%)

3. Addressing Concerns About Hash‚Äôs Adoption

You‚Äôre absolutely right to be cautious about Hash token adoption and the limited buying pressure right now. However, here‚Äôs how you can position this challenge as an opportunity:
	‚Ä¢	Align with Providence‚Äôs Push:
Promote your ISPO as a way for early adopters to get exposure to a project building on the largest RWA blockchain right as the network gains momentum.
	‚Ä¢	Leverage Utility Messaging:
Emphasize that RV Tokens have clear utility (rewards, payments, governance), which distinguishes your offering from many other speculative ISPOs.
	‚Ä¢	Incentivize Long-Term Staking:
Add a vesting or lockup period for ISPO rewards. This encourages participants to stake Hash and hold RV tokens while Providence builds its market presence.

Final Thoughts
	‚Ä¢	Go with 5% for the ISPO allocation‚Äîstrong enough to build interest without being overly dilutive.
	‚Ä¢	Set your total supply at 100M RV Tokens unless you anticipate significant future utility demands (in which case 250M works).
	‚Ä¢	Position Rove as a utility-driven project that‚Äôs well-timed for the Providence blockchain growth in 2025. This narrative will appeal to both Web3 early adopters and traditional investors.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like me to refine this further or adjust the breakdown! üöÄ
