The easiest way to stake your $Hash to a validator is by using the [Provenance Blockchain Explorer.](https://explorer.provenance.io/)

#### How to stake HASH (Provenance)

##### 1\. Connect Your Wallet to Explorer

If you have a Provenance Blockchain or Figure Wallet, navigate to the Provenance Blockchain Explorer and click the "Connect Wallet" key in the upper right-hand corner and select your wallet type:

Select a Wallet Type to Connect

Once your wallet is connected, the Explorer will show the wallet address is in use and the Key will change to a User profile icon:

##### 2\. Select validator

With your wallet connected, click the **Staking** menu option to display the list of Validators:

Available Validators List

The Validator list shows the Validators that are available to Delegate to. Clicking the Moniker or Address column for the Validator will show details about the Validator. These details are important when considering a Validator as they demonstrate the Validator's shares, commissions, and delegators:

From the Validator List, click the **Delegate** button next to the Validator you wish to stake with:

Click Delegate to Stake Hash with Selected Validator

##### 3\. Enter the amount of Hash

Explorer will display important information about the selected Validator and provide an input to enter the amount of Hash you wish to delegate:

##### 4\. Sign

Once the **Delegate** button is clicked, Explorer will prompt you to sign the transaction with your wallet. Once signed and submitted, the delegation will show in the Provenance Blockchain Validators List:

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63fdf8c863bcf00d7ffdff91/641ad42c488471151c912ddd_spaces%252F-MiQIBYc4cIX7twv8pTe%252Fuploads%252FkZJfH2uIGUcGqhiTI6lN%252F7-sign.png)

How to Manage Your Delegations from Explorer

Once you have delegated Hash to a Validator you can undelegate or redelegate your Hash. When you undelegate, your Hash will not be available for 21 days. You can redelegate to a different Validator at any time.

From the **Staking** menu the My Validators list shows the Validators you have delegated to. Click the **Manage** button to adjust your delegations:

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63fdf8c863bcf00d7ffdff91/641ad42c5b93f3e2048c7231_spaces%252F-MiQIBYc4cIX7twv8pTe%252Fuploads%252F80Z99qJmkjBt97pARYkp%252F8-manage.png)

Your rewards for a given validator are immediately claimed when you change your delegation against it, which is reflected in the transaction log.
